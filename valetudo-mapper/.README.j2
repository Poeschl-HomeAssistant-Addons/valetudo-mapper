## Config

The config of the addon is identical to the `mqtt` section described in the README of Valetudo Mapper.
The `webserver` section is fixed to `{ "enabled": true, "port": 3000 }`

If you use the Mosquitto Addon in Home Assistant `core-mosquitto` can be used as broker address like this: `mqtt://<user>:<password>@core-mosquitto`.

## PNG image

The generated image will be served over the Supervisor Ingress feature. So the floor plan can be accessed via the build-in side panel or the auto-configured mqtt camera.
